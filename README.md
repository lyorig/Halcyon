# HalodaQuest

This is nothing more than a hobby project of mine, on which I intend to practice various C++ idioms and good coding practices in general, along with CMake and Git.

## Made with Halcyon

Included are several independent libraries.
- **Halcyon**  
A C++ SDL wrapper, focused on speed and ease of use.
- **AL++**
Another C++ wrapper, this time of OpenAL.
- **lyoSTL**  
Various classes and types that enhance and simplify coding.
