# Halcyon

A slim, performant SDL wrapper written in modern C++.

## Installation
Halcyon works best (probably only) with CMake.
1. clone the repository into your project directory.
  > **Warning:** Do a shallow clone, as there was a time when actual MP3 and WAV files were stored here.
2. in your CMakeLists.txt, `include(halcyon/config.cmake)`. This should configure everything, and you're good to go.
